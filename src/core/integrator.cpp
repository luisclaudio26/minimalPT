  // Here we need to keep in mind that we are sampling
  // IRRADIANCE at film positions, and our goal is
  // to integrate it all to know the total POWER arriving
  // at a given pixel. The Monte Carlo strategy then is
  // to sample irradiance at different points in the
  // film pixel, compute its mean and multiply by the
  // pixel size, which is the Monte Carlo estimative for
  // the integral of irradiance over area, which is POWER.
  //
  // Notice that there's a subtlety here: to compute irradiance
  // at a given point, we need to integrate radiance over
  // the hemisphere of directions, weighting   //return (isect.normal + 1.0f)*0.5f;
  //return isect.normal;by the cosine (Lambert's
  // cosine law). A realistic camera model would do this by sampling
  // many different directions for the same point, and each one of these
  // directions would generate a ray that passes through the lens and goes
  // to the scene (or, speaking in Area terms - not Solid Angle, we would sample
  // the lens). Given that our camera is a pinhole, the radiance
  // function is a DELTA, being zero everywhere but at the direction
  // linking the sample position and the camera pinhole. Thus,
  // its integral (i.e. the irradiance at the point) is simply
  // the radiance arriving from this ray, weighted by the cosine.
  //
  // It is very important to correctly compute these quantities,
  // and one should never forget the DOMAIN MEASURE term of the
  // Monte Carlo integral, otherwise the quantities will be
  // meaningless. For a film where all pixels have the same size
  // this would not be a problem and the final image would "make sense",
  // but the quantities itself would be underestimated (our final image is
  // biased). This would pose a problem if we wanted to apply a
  // camera response curve to simulate a given camera behavior.
  //
  // Moreover, realistic films do not measure power, but actual
  // energy (which is just power integrated over time). Even more realistic
  // films would consider dependence on wavelength (?).
  //
  // Plenoptic camera simulation would require a film that records estimatives
  // for RADIANCE, not irradiance, by discretizing the hemisphere of directions.
